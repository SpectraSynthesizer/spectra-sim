Cinderella-Stepmother Simulation
=================================================================================

This program simulates the Cinderella-Stepmother game with 5 buckets. Cinderella's goal is
to prevent the stepmother from overflowing one of the buckets.

To use the simulation do the following steps:
1. Choose parameter values for the problem - the number of adjacent buckets Cinderella can empty in
   one turn, the number of water units the stepmother can add in one turn, and the capacity
   of the buckets. Edit the "bucketsToEmpty", "addedWaterUnits", and "capacity" parameters of 
   Board.java in src folder accordingly to match the values you chose.
2. In CinderellaStepmotherN5.spectra edit the defines C (number of bucket Cinderella can
   empty), B (bucket capacity) and A (number of water units the stepmother
   adds) with the parameter values you chose, and synthesize a symbolic controller for the 
   specification.
3. Run the java simulation.
